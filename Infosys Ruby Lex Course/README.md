# Infosys Ruby Lex Course Exercises

1. Problem Statement:

Objective: Develop a Ruby program to store the train number, train name, and also the rating provided for the train with the total cost.

Problem Description: InfyRail is an online train inquiry application that is used to check for the details of trains on a particular route. Define four variables train_number, train_name, rating, and total_cost, and store different values for them.
